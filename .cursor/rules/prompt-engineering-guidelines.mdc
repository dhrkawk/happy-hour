# Prompt Engineering Guidelines for AI Assistance

> **Purpose**  
> Provide a concise set of best-practice rules for writing high-quality prompts that reliably guide the AI assistant on this project.

## ✅ MUST DO

1. **State the Objective First**  
   Start every prompt with a clear, single-sentence goal (e.g. *“Generate a FastAPI endpoint for user signup.”*).  
2. **Give Context Minimally but Clearly**  
   Mention only the files or concepts strictly required.  
   • Reference code via markdown links: `[main.py](mdc:backend/app/main.py)`  
   • Quote config snippets instead of entire files.  
3. **Specify Output Style**  
   Tell the model exactly *what* to output: _code diff_, _plain text list_, _Mermaid diagram_, etc.  
4. **Constrain the Scope**  
   Use bullets or check-lists to delimit multi-step tasks.  
   Example: *“Create TWO new files: X, Y. Edit ONE existing file: Z.”*  
5. **Highlight Success Criteria**  
   Include acceptance tests, lint rules, or API response examples so the AI can self-check.
6. **Prefer Active Voice & Imperatives**  
   “Add”, “Remove”, “Refactor”, not “It would be nice to…”.
7. **Iterate Incrementally**  
   Break large changes into small, verifiable steps—one prompt per commit when possible.

## ❌ NEVER DO

1. **Do NOT Paste Secrets**  
   Avoid API keys, .env contents, or personal data.
2. **Do NOT Dump Huge Files**  
   Instead, link the file (`[foo.ts](mdc:frontend/src/foo.ts)`), or quote only the relevant lines.
3. **No Ambiguous Pronouns**  
   Replace “it”, “that”, “this” with explicit nouns.
4. **Avoid Vague Requirements**  
   Phrases like “make it better” or “optimize everything” lack measurable criteria.
5. **No Contradictory Instructions**  
   Ensure earlier rules are not negated later in the same prompt.
6. **Never Exceed One Goal per Prompt**  
   Split disparate tasks across prompts; keeps reasoning focused.

## 🔧 Example High-Quality Prompt
```
Objective: Add a health-check endpoint to FastAPI.

Context:
- File to edit: [main.py](mdc:backend/app/main.py)
- Existing router setup follows `api_router = APIRouter()`.

Task list:
1. Create `health.py` under `backend/app/api/`.
2. Define GET `/health` returning `{status:"ok"}`.
3. Import & include router in `main.py`.

Acceptance:
- Running `uvicorn main:app` then `GET /health` responds `200` with JSON above.
- Pass `flake8`.

Output: Provide a code diff.
```
